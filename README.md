# Remote-Code-Management-Facility

Purpose:
This project implements a facility for remote code management (RCM). Management consists of transferring files to and from the local and remote machines, exploring a directory subtree on a remote machine, identifying files and searching for specific texts within files. The facility will use communication software you built in Project #3 to start search tasks on a remote server and return results while serving multiple concurrent clients.

Requirements:
Your Message-Passing Communication project:

1. shall use standard C++ and the standard library, compile and link from the command line, using Visual Studio 2013, as provided in the ECS clusters and operate in the environment provided there1.

2. shall use services of the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), using either C# or C++/CLI, for all input and output to and from the user’s console and C++ smart pointers for all server dynamic memory management.

3. (3) shall provide a server application that supports uploading and downloading source code files2, exploring one specific directory subtree, and performing file searches and concurrent string searches3 within source code files in that tree.

4. (3) Shall provide a client process that uses Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) to build a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that supports file transfer and processing requests and displaying results and performance information.

5. (3) Shall, for text search commands, accept one or more end-point addresses to specify machines to search, wild cards to specify file patterns to match, and regular expressions to specify text to find.

6. (4) Shall, in response to a text search command, return a list of files that contain the text and the paths and machines on which they reside.

7. (4) Shall, in response to a file search command, passing a path4 and file patterns, return a list of files with their paths found in the directory subtree rooted at the specified path. The client shall provide the option5 to return an XML string showing the entire directory subtree containing matched files.

8. (1) shall support concurrent processing of text searches, including the capability to specify, at the client, the number of threads that will participate in that server processing.

9. (1) Shall enable the measurement of time required to carry out a processing request and also the end-to-end time to request a processing task and receive the corresponding reply. Please display the results in milliseconds.

10. (1) shall use the high resolution timer provided by the std::chrono library.

11. The GUI client and server shall display information to demonstrate clearly and succinctly that all requirements of this project have been met6.
